## 🎨 Game Mechanics

### Combat System
- **Real-time Combat**: Towers automatically target and attack enemies within range
- **Projectile Physics**: Watch projectiles travel from towers to enemies
- **Area Effects**: Some towers (Fire, Bomb) damage multiple enemies
- **Special Effects**: Ice towers slow enemies, Fire towers burn over time

### Progression System
- **Wave Scaling**: Each wave increases enemy count and difficulty
- **XP Rewards**: Earn XP from defeated enemies to unlock upgrades
- **Gold Economy**: Balance spending on towers vs. saving for upgrades
- **Lives System**: Lose lives when enemies reach the end of the path

### Map System
- **Grid-based Placement**: Towers snap to a grid for strategic positioning
- **Pathfinding**: Enemies follow predefined paths through the map
- **Dynamic Map Loading**: Maps are loaded from JSON configuration
